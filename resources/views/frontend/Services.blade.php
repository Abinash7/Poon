            The distinction between a good and a service remains disputed. The perspective in the late-eighteenth and
            early-nineteenth centuries focused on creation and possession of wealth. Classical economists contended
            that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership
            implied tangible possession of an object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the
            producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner.
            Adam Smithâ€™s famous book, The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, distinguished between the outputs of
            what he termed "productive" and "unproductive" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that
            could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value.
            The latter, however useful or necessary, created services that perished at the time of production
            and therefore did not contribute to wealth. Building on this theme, French economist Jean-Baptiste
            Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term "immaterial
            products" to describe them.
