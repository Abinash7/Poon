<h1>Our Services</h1>
<p>The distinction between a good and a service remains disputed. The perspective in the late-eighteenth and 
    early-nineteenth centuries focused on creation and possession of wealth. Classical economists contended 
    that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership 
   <p> implied tangible possession of an object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the 
    producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner.</p>
</p> Adam Smithâ€™s famous book, The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, distinguished between the outputs of
     what he termed "productive" and "unproductive" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that
      could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value.</p> 
</p>The latter, however useful or necessary, created services that perished at the time of production 
      and therefore did not contribute to wealth. Building on this theme, French economist Jean-Baptiste 
      Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term "immaterial 
      products" to describe them.</p>
